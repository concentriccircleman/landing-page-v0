### Sentra Landing Page — Agent Rules

### Non‑negotiables
- **MUST: Never stage commits** as if the user runs `/undo` it'll remove all untracked files from the Git history. Known bug in 0.77 in Codex CLI.
- **MUST: Use pnpm** as the package manager (NOT npm, yarn, or bun).
  - **MUST**: Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, etc.
  - **MUST NOT**: Run `pnpm dev` (it is already running in the background).
  - **MUST NOT**: Run `pnpm dev` by default (assume it is already running in the background).
- **MUST NOT** stop/kill the existing dev server process.
  - **Exception**: If there’s a dev-server issue and you need to validate that your change fixes the output, starting `pnpm dev` is allowed.
  - If you do start it, **do not stop the existing process**—run your instance separately.
- **MUST: No rounding on anything.**
  - **MUST NOT**: Use Tailwind `rounded`, `rounded-*`, `ring-offset-*` patterns that create rounded corners, or any CSS `border-radius`.
  - **MUST**: Keep edges crisp and rectangular across cards, buttons, pills/tags, images, modals, and containers.

### TypeScript + React conventions
- **MUST: Use TypeScript interfaces over types.**
- **MUST: Keep interfaces on the file’s top-level scope** (do not nest inside functions/components).
- **MUST: Use arrow functions over function declarations.**
- **MUST: Do not type cast (`as`) unless absolutely necessary.**
- **MUST: Use descriptive names for variables** (avoid shorthands, or 1–2 character names).
  - **Example**: for `.map()`, use `innerItem` instead of `x`.
  - **Example**: instead of `moved`, use `didPositionChange`.
- **MUST: Remove unused code and don’t repeat yourself.**

### Commenting
- **NEVER** comment unless absolutely necessary.
  - If it is a hack (e.g., `setTimeout`, browser quirks, confusing workaround), it **MUST** be prefixed with `// HACK: reason for hack`.

### Files, naming, and structure
- **MUST: Use kebab-case for files** (e.g., `hero-header.tsx`, `fade-variants.ts`).
- **MUST** follow the existing Next.js App Router structure:
  - **Routes** live under `src/app/` (with route groups like `(home)` and `(main)`).
  - **Page-specific components** live under `src/app/**/_components/`.
  - **Shared components** live under `src/components/`.
- **MUST** use the existing import alias style (`@/…`) for internal imports.

### Styling patterns (Tailwind v4)
- **MUST** use Tailwind utilities and the existing design tokens:
  - Use `bg-foreground`, `text-background`, `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-primary-*`, etc.
  - Use the custom layout pattern: `max-w-screen-4xl mx-auto w-full`.
- **MUST NOT** use inline CSS (`style={{ ... }}`) no matter what.
  - **ONLY exception**: when Tailwind cannot achieve the **exact** behavior. In that case, keep the inline style minimal and tightly scoped.
- **MUST** prefer existing helpers for class composition:
  - Use `cn()` from `src/utils/cn.ts` when combining conditional classes.
- **MUST** keep UI simple and high-contrast (foreground/background token-driven), consistent with the current landing aesthetic.
- **MUST** never use [] to define styles. Always use default values UNLESS a specific behaviour requested by the user can only be achieved using them.

### Animation patterns
- **MUST** use `motion/react` (not other animation libraries).
- **MUST** centralize reusable variants/transitions in `src/app/_animations/` (e.g., `fadeVariants`, `fadeTransition`) and reuse them across pages/components.

### Safety / scope rules
- **NEVER** use destructive git commands (e.g., `git reset --hard`).
- **MUST** follow the user’s requests exactly, unless the request has known security issues.
- If a task/request is **ambiguous** or could reasonably refer to **multiple different things**, **MUST** ask for clarification before making changes (e.g., “make the title in the todos blue” but there are multiple `Todo` components—ask which one, or whether to change all).
- **MUST** attempt only one fix at a time when resolving faults/errors/unexpected output.
- **MUST** fix the root cause; do not use duct-tape solutions unless all reasonable attempts have failed.
- If the user reports **no visible change** or the **error still occurs** after a fix, **MUST** undo the fix before attempting a new one.
- **MUST** do only what is asked; do not perform extra work beyond instructions or “nice-to-haves”.
